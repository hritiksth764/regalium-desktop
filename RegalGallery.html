        <p class="gallery-description">
          This double-storied, naturally lit space is airy, grand, and dynamic —
          it is designed to host events, exhibitions, shows, and more. It is
          designed to ensure the highest level of audio-visual experience —
          integrated with end-to-end technology to do so.<br /><br />

          Bearing in mind the ever-evolving nature of art, artists, and
          enthusiasts, we cater to experiences that traverse into the digital
          verse — as a gallery space of the future, the Regal Gallery is
          designed to take on digital showcases, as well.<br /><br />

          Digital galleries are an imperative part of the future, and create
          opportunities at Regalium for the imagination of our community to
          continually evolve and expand. With our digital activations — across
          events and experiences — we serve a curious community with the most
          faultless amenities.
